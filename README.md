# DLGaitAssessment

Deep learning for assessment of gait parameters such as assymmetry, double support time and stride length.

## Get started

To get started, make sure you have a PKL file of the video you want to assess gait. You can do that by running the script found in https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nmbWslWQdANCqDGTZnwjDNkZogfzkEDw on your video.

To get the best result, make you can:

- Wear clothes that makes it easy to differentiate between body parts.
- Ensure the subjects entire body is visible in every frame of the video.
- The subject is walking on flat ground
